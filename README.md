# Smart Study Planner 🚀

Hey there! Welcome to your new best friend for staying on top of studies – the Smart Study Planner! This simple web app helps you jot down your study tasks, set reminders so you never miss a deadline, and keep everything organized right in your browser. No fancy servers or sign-ups needed – just pure productivity boost! 📚✨

## What Can It Do? (Features)

- **Quick Task Creation**: Pop in a task title, add some details if you want, pick a due date, and set a reminder time. Easy peasy!
- **Manage Your Tasks**: See all your tasks in a neat list. Snooze reminders when life gets busy (default 5 minutes, but you choose!), or delete them with a quick × or full button.
- **Saves Everything Locally**: Your tasks stick around in your browser's storage – refresh, close, come back later, they're still there! No data loss worries.
- **Smart Reminders**: Get a friendly sound alert when it's time (checks every 10 seconds to be super timely). Snooze and get reminded again – perfect for those "just 5 more minutes" moments.
- **Looks Good Everywhere**: Clean, modern design that works great on your phone, laptop, or tablet. No clunky interfaces here!

## What's Under the Hood? (Tech Stack)

- **Front-End Magic**: Plain HTML5, CSS3 (love those smooth gradients and flex layouts), and good old JavaScript – no frameworks, just straightforward code.
- **Storage**: Your browser's Local Storage keeps things safe and simple.
- **Sounds**: Built-in HTML5 audio for those gentle reminder beeps.

## How to Get Started (Super Easy!)

1. **Grab the Files**: Download or copy these files: index.html, styles.css, script.js, and this README.
2. **Fire It Up**: Just double-click index.html – it'll open in your favorite browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, you name it!).
3. **Add Your First Task**: Fill out the form – title, description (optional), due date, and reminder time if needed. Hit "Add Task" and watch it appear!
4. **Stay Organized**: Scroll through your task list, snooze reminders with "Remind Again", or zap unwanted ones with the delete options.
5. **Reminder Time**: Set a time for today, keep the tab open, and let the app nudge you with a sound when it's go-time.

### Quick Tips for Smooth Sailing
- **Audio & Permissions**: The first time, your browser might ask to play sounds – say yes for reminders to work their magic!
- **Keep It Open**: Reminders only chime in if the page is loaded. Close the tab? They'll wait till you reopen.

## The Files (What's What)

- **index.html**: The main page where all the action happens.
- **styles.css**: Makes everything look pretty and professional.
- **script.js**: The brains – handles adding tasks, saving stuff, and those clever reminders.

## A Few Heads-Ups (Limitations)

- Reminders need the page open to work – it's a browser thing!
- Tasks save across sessions, but reminders are one-day wonders (set new ones as needed).
- Some browsers are picky about auto-playing sounds – just interact with the page first, and you're good.
